Update README with full overview and links to examples
# Harrison's Security Notes

Welcome! This repository documents my cybersecurity learning journey, covering both **web application** and **smart contract / Web3 security**.  

The goal is to practice, document, and share hands-on examples of common vulnerabilities, along with mitigation strategies.  

---

## Web Security Examples

- [XSS Example](xss-example.md) – Cross-Site Scripting  
- [SQL Injection Example](sql-injection-example.md) – SQL Injection  
- [CSRF Example](csrf-example.md) – Cross-Site Request Forgery  
- [Broken Access Control](broken-access-control.md) – Unauthorized access issues  
- [Security Misconfigurations](security-misconfigurations.md) – Server and app misconfigurations  

---

## Smart Contract / Web3 Security Examples

- [Reentrancy Example](reentrancy-example.md) – Reentrancy attacks  
- [Integer Overflow / Underflow](integer-overflow.md) – Arithmetic vulnerabilities  
- [Access Control Issues](access-control-issues.md) – Admin function misuse

## Learning Path

1. Started with **web vulnerabilities** (OWASP Top 10)  
2. Practiced **hands-on labs** for each vulnerability  
3. Moved to **smart contract security**, including reentrancy and access control issues  
4. Documenting every step in this repository  

---

## Goal

To continuously improve my vulnerability detection skills, share knowledge, and contribute to a safer web and Web3 ecosystem.

## Notes

- Each file contains **vulnerable scenarios, attack examples, impact, and mitigation strategies**  
- All examples are for **educational purposes only**
